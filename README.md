# Modelling Intrusion Detection: Analysis of a Feature Selection Mechanism
Machine Learning with the NSL-KDD dataset for Network Intrusion Detection.
 DecisionTree_IDS.ipynb contains the analysis using Decision Tree Classifier.
 RandomForest_IDS.ipynb Contains the analysis using Random Forest Classifier.
 
 This work aims to verify the work done by Nkiama, Said and Saidu (2016) in: https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume7No4/Paper_19-A_Subset_Feature_Elimination_Mechanism_for_Intrusion_Detection_System.pdf
 
 ***Disclaimer: Very old project - not state-of-the-art - one of my first experiences with ML ;)
